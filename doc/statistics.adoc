[[jack.max_delayed_usecs]]
* *jack.max_delayed_usecs* ( _client_ ) _M_ +
-> _delay_ +
[small]#Returns the maximum delay reported by the backend since startup or reset.#


[[jack.xrun_delayed_usecs]]
* *jack.xrun_delayed_usecs* ( _client_ ) _M_ +
-> _delay_ +
[small]#Returns the delay in microseconds due to the most recent xrun occurrence.#


[[jack.reset_max_delayed_usecs]]
* *jack.reset_max_delayed_usecs* ( _client_ ) _M_ +
[small]#Resets the maximum delay counter.#


[[jack.profile]]
* *jack.profile* ( _client_ [, _what_ ]) +
*jack.profile* ( _client_ ) +
-> _n_, _min_, _max_, _mean_, _var_ +
[small]#Profile the real-time callbacks for _client_. +
The _what_ parameter may be one amongst 
_start_ (reset the counters and start profiling), 
_stop_ (stop profiling), and 
_restart_ (start profiling, but do not reset the counters).
If the _what_ parameter is _nil_ (or none), the function returns
the number of profiled callbacks, followed by the minimum, maximum,
mean and variance of the time (in seconds) they consumed.
Please note that these are only rough estimates.#
