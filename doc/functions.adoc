== LuaJack functions

LuaJack functions are described in the following subsections. All of them are members of the *jack* table.

The letters _M_, _P_ and/or _T_ beside a function description indicate whether it is available
in the main context (_M_), in process contexts (_P_) and/or in thread contexts (_T_).
For example, _MP_ means that the function is available in the main context and in process contexts, but
not in thread contexts.

On error, unless otherwise pointed out, all functions call Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-error[error]() with a string message handler.
