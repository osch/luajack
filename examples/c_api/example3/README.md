####LuaJack C-API - Example 3

This example enhances Example 2 by adding, in the client thread, a simple GUI 
that displays the number of pings and pongs exchanged with the process thread
via the ringbuffers.

The GUI is implemented using [MoonFLTK](https://github.com/stetre/moonfltk).

#####Running the example

Same as Example 1.
